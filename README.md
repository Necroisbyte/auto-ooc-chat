# auto-ooc-chat
Fivem's chat with an auto ooc for main chat so you don't need to type /ooc.

DISCLAIMER: This script is just an edit of fiveM's server chat. I do not own or have I created this from scratch, all other coding other than what I have added and edited belong to fiveM.

Just replace this resource in [System] under your server's resource folder and /restart chat.

Instead of having to have a /ooc chat, it automatically adds OOC | to all normal chat.
Also changed the color from the unreadable grey to a yellow.
